# tldr

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of **tldr** is to provide short-form documentation in the console, styled with <a href = "https://github.com/r-lib/cli">**cli**</a>:

![tldr-ex-1](man/README-gifs/tldr-tldr.gif)

Included are RStudio addins which, when bound to keyboard shortcuts, 
facilitate efficient access to **tldr** documentation:

![tldr-ex-2](man/README-gifs/tldrExample-divide.gif)

**tldr** is inspired by <a href="https://tldr.sh/">tldr-pages</a>,
a project which provides simpler documentation for command-line tools.

## Writing **tldr** documentation

This package includes a Roxygen2 extension which allows for the creation of **tldr** documentation files from Roxygen skeletons.
This is done via `tldr_roclet()` and custom Roxygen tags such as `@paramtldr` and `@exampletldr`.
Once the system for documentation is more stable, we will be writing a guide on its use for other developers.
For an example of what a package with **tldr**-style documentation looks like,
there is another package, <a href="https://Github.com/jamesotto852/tldrExample">**tldrExample**</a>, 
which exports several simple objects with Roxygen skeletons that produce **tldr** documentation.

## How it works

`tldr_roclet()` creates .Rd files based on relevant tags in the Roxygen skeleton (including the new `@paramtldr` and `@exampletldr`).
These .Rd files are written to the `/inst/tldr/` directory.
Once the package is installed, `tldr_help()` and `tldr_package()`
are able to find the relevant files which are turned into console output by `tldr()`.

This process is inspired by the `help()` function---for those who are interested, I have a 
<a href="https://jamesotto852.github.io/Understanding-base-documentation-functions">blog post</a>
in which I go through how `?` and `help()` work in detail.

## Installation

**tldr** is in an experimental stage and is not ready to be used as a tool by R users and developers.
That being said, if you are interested in installing **tldr** you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jamesotto852/tldr")
```
